A one pager is a concise, one-page document that summarizes key information and presents it in a clear and visually appealing way. It's often used for business meetings, pitches, proposals, and other contexts where a brief overview of an idea or project is required.

## What is a One Pager?

A one pager typically consists of a few key elements:

* A brief introduction or summary
* Key statistics, metrics, or data points
* Visuals such as images, charts, or graphs to support the information
* A clear call-to-action (CTA) or recommendation

The purpose of a one pager is to provide a quick and easy-to-understand overview of an idea or project. It's designed to be shared with others, whether it's during a meeting, in a pitch, or as part of a proposal.
