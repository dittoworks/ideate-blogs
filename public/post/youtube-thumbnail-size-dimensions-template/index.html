<p>When it comes to promoting your YouTube videos, a well-designed thumbnail can make all the difference. But before you start writing that script or picking up your camera, let&rsquo;s flip this process on its head – if you have an awesome video idea, shouldn&rsquo;t you focus on crafting a compelling thumbnail first? Your thumbnail is often the first thing viewers see, and it sets the tone for their entire viewing experience. In fact, we believe that creating a great thumbnail should be the first step in your video-making process.</p>
